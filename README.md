## Usage

Exports [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) Promise library v3.x.

Why on earth would you use this rather than bluebird itself? Well you probably wouldn't, and shouldn't.

Only reason is along with [bluebird2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird2) if you need to load both versions v2.x and v3.x of bluebird simultaneously, for example for running tests on a module which should work with either version.

```js
var Bluebird2 = require('bluebird2');
var Bluebird3 = require('bluebird3');
// Now you have both. Whoopee!
```

### `Bluebird.getNewLibraryCopy()`

This module adds one method to the Bluebird constructor if not present already: `.getNewLibraryCopy()`

`.getNewLibraryCopy()` returns a new independent instance of the Bluebird constructor.

```js
var Bluebird = require('bluebird3');
var BluebirdX = Bluebird.getNewLibraryCopy();

console.log(BluebirdX != Bluebird); // true
```

### `Bluebird.version`

The module adds `.version` property to the Bluebird constructor, containing the semver version of Bluebird.

```js
var Bluebird = require('bluebird3');
console.log(Bluebird.version); // e.g. '3.3.5'
```

## Tests

Use `npm test` to run the tests. Use `npm run cover` to check coverage.
